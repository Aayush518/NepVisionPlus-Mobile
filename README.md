# NepVisionPlus-Mobile

NepVisionPlus is a mobile application that demonstrates three AI models developed for Nepali language processing. The app processes uploaded videos to generate Nepali captions for video frames, creates a summary of the video content in Nepali, and converts the generated text to speech using a Nepali TTS model. This application was developed as a final year project to showcase the practical implementation of these AI models in a user-friendly interface.
